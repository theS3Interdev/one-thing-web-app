# One Thing App

## Summary

When I was brand new to React.JS, this was the project I cut my teeth on.

The UI was kept very simple so that I could focus on concepts like creating components, using and passing state, handling events, prop drilling, and more!

Finally, the repetitive process of building and deploying the project to production was automated by using GitHub Actions for onward deployment to Firebase Hosting.
